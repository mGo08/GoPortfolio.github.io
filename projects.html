                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>The mobile Java calculator was my first real big application, developed using Android Studio (Lollipop version). Its purpose was to create a basic calculator that could perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project introduced me to Android development, where I learned to handle user inputs, design a user interface, and understand the structure of Android applications. Although I had no prior experience in Java, having previously worked with Lua for game modifications, I managed to overcome the challenges of transitioning to a new programming language and platform. Despite the difficulties, the project gave me valuable hands-on experience in mobile app development and boosted my confidence in problem-solving and coding.</p>
