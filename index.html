            Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at Mapua Malayan Colleges Mindanao. With a strong passion for technology, 
            I am dedicated to advancing my skills and creativity in the field of computer science. I actively engage in various areas of study, including programming, system design, and data structures, 
            with a focus on applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects. I believe in continuous learning and strive to expand my expertise through both academic pursuits and hands-on experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="section_paragraph">
            As I continue my academic journey, I have actively sought out opportunities to explore advanced topics such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 
            along with projects involving coffee shops and car rental services, aiming to develop practical solutions that integrate technology with real-world challenges. 
            In addition to my academic work, I have engaged in extracurricular activities like esports, where I have developed valuable skills in teamwork, strategy, 
            and critical thinking. This portfolio highlights the projects and achievements that demonstrate my growth, technical expertise, and dedication to making a positive 
            impact in the tech industry.
