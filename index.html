            Born in 2004 in Davao City, Philippines.
        </p>
        <p class="section_paragraph">
            Currently a second-year Computer Science student at Mapua Malayan Colleges Mindanao. With a strong passion for technology, 
            I am dedicated to advancing my skills and creativity in the field of computer science. I actively engage in various areas of study, including programming, system design, and data structures, 
            with a focus on applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects. I believe in continuous learning and strive to expand my expertise through both academic pursuits and hands-on experiences.

        <p class="section_paragraph">
            My interest in coding began in 2012 when I discovered Garry’s Mod, 
            a sandbox game that introduced me to the world of programming and 
            digital creation. What started as simple in-game modifications quickly 
            grew into a fascination with scripting, browser extensions, and 
            reverse-engineering game files. This early curiosity evolved into a passion 
            for software development, problem-solving, and understanding how technology 
            can be leveraged to build innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="section_paragraph">
            As I progress in my studies, I have explored advanced topics such as the 
            Internet of Things (IoT) and have worked on projects related to coffee shop 
            and car rental services, aiming to develop technology-driven solutions for 
            real-world challenges. Beyond academics, my involvement in esports has helped 
            me cultivate valuable skills in teamwork, strategy, and critical thinking—qualities 
            that translate well into the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p class="section_paragraph">
            This portfolio showcases my projects, achievements, 
            and the journey that has shaped me into the developer 
            I am today. I am excited to continue growing, learning, 
            and making meaningful contributions to the field of technology.
